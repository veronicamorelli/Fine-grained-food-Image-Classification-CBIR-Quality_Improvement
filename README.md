# Visual_Information_Processing_And_Management

The project consists in the development of an application for the recognition of two-dimensional signals (images) of fine-grained food. Specifically we have developed three different tasks:

1. Image pre-processing: pipeline definition for quality improvement
2. Fine-grained food classification
3. Similarity retrieval (category search)

# How to run the code
Unless otherwise specified in the notebook section all codes can be runned in Google Colaboratory platform. All notebooks all already setted to import the necessary packages and also in this way you can easily use a GPU!
